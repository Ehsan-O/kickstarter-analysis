# Kickstarting with Excel

## **Overview of Project**
in this project we are helping a client with her fundrasing campaign

### **Purpose**
Our client is a playwright who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play. She wants to know if there is any relations between the launch date and funding goals of the campaigns and their success rate.
We extracted and used the data from a corowdfunding campaign website to perform our analysis.

## **Analysis and Challenges**
Our analysis consists of two parts as follows
1. Analysis of outcomes based on launch Date of the campaigns related to theater
2. Analysis of outcomes based on fundig goals of play campagins

we elaborate on each in the following sections.

### **Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date**
The launch dates provided in the data (column"J" of the "kickstarter" sheet excel file: kickstarter challenge.xlsx) are unix timestamps so first we needed to convert them to gregorian date format (Column "S" and "T" of the kickstarter sheet)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
